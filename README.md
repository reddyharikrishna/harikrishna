### Talking Parents understands that not all conversations can take place over text and has developed a calling feature that provides increased responsibility for co-parents through securely placed calls for Premium users within the United States and Canada. The calling feature includes downloadable audio and text transcript files of all calls. Current Talking Parents customers can upgrade to a Premium account and start calling their co-parent through the iOS or Android mobile apps. Talking Parents' founder and attorney Stephen Nixon says, "This feature will dramatically improve the way that co-parents communicate while keeping both parties accountable for the words they say."

Accountable Calling will join existing Talking Parents features, including Secure Messaging, Shared Calendar, File Vault, Attachment Library, and the Personal Journal. Talking Parents aims to help co-parents avoid and resolve disputes by creating accurate and unalterable Records of all their interactions. Customers can order Calling, Messaging, and Calendar Records as digital PDF downloads or certified printed hard copies. Now with Accountable Calling, parents are empowered to communicate clearly and securely within the Talking Parents mobile app.
